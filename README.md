# TVHPlayer

Samsung SmartTV Player widget for [TV Headend](https://tvheadend.org).

## Compatibility

:warning: I've only tested it with my 2011 Samsung TV - UE40D6500, but it's very likely this would work with 2012/2013 TVs as well.

## Installation

- Download and install [Samsung 2011 Main SDK (SDK 2.5.1)](http://samsungdforum.com/Devtools/SdkDownload)

- Clone this repo and copy the entire directory into `Program Files (x86)\Samsung\Samsung TV SDK(2.5.1)\Apps` directory
- Follow [Testing Your Application on a TV for 2011](http://samsungdforum.com/Guide/?FolderName=art00013&FileName=index.html) guide to complete the installation process

## What works

- Listing channels
- Viewing EPG details
- Playback

## Known issues

- channel icons won't load when image caching is enabled and user login is required
- ???
